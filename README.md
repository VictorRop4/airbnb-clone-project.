# airThe Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. I'm using this project to learn how to build complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.
